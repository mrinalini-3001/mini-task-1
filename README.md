# Pressure Activated Light-Up Umbrella
If the measured pressure using piezo disks is greater than a given threshold then it triggers a string of LEDs. This project uses an Arduino, piezo disks and multiplexers which is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards to a single output line.

# Social Distancing Card
The project involves using ultrasonic sensor attached to an Arduino to alert the user when the distance between the other person and the user falls below a threshold value.

# Non-Contact Thermometer
The temperature is measured using MLX90614, an IR Temperature sensor, attached to an Arduino. It also has an I2C (interface to communicate). Since the thermometer measures the temperature without contact, it can prevent the spreading of any virus or bacteria from an infected person. 

# Automatic Water Tap
Making an automatic water tap by using an Arduino, a distance sensor and a solinoid valve. Solinoid valve is an electro-mechanical device that operates based on the input voltage. The valve is activated when the distance falls below a certain threshold value.
