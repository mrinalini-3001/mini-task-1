# Pressure Activated Light-Up Umbrella
If the measured pressure using piezo disks is greater than a given threshold then it triggers a string of LEDs. This project uses an Arduino, piezo disks and multiplexers which is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards to a single output line.

# Non-Contact Thermometer
The temperature is measured using MLX90614, an IR Temperature sensor, attached to an Arduino. It also has an I2C (interface to communicate). Since the thermometer measures the temperature without contact, it can prevent the spreading of any virus or bacteria from an infected person. 

# Automatic Water Tap
Making an automatic water tap by using an Arduino, a distance sensor and a solinoid valve. Solinoid valve is an electro-mechanical device that operates based on the input voltage. The valve is activated when the distance falls below a certain threshold value.

# Social Distancing Card
The project involves using ultrasonic sensor attached to an Arduino to alert the user when the distance between the other person and the user falls below a threshold value.

# IoT Liquid Level Monitoring System
This project monitors the liquid level by using an Arduino, ultrasonic sensors to detect the level and buzzer to alert the user. This project will warn the user if the level of the liquid crosses a threshold value and prevent overflowing. 

# Arduino PID based DC Motor Position Control
The project aims at building an Arduino PID (Proportional derivative and integral calculation-based DC motor Position Control System). A double shaft simple DC gear motor is connected with the shaft of encoder on one side and on another side, is connected with a pointer. This pointer points to the angle marked on the protractor, an encoder is connected with Arduino on interrupt pins and DC motor drive by L293D motor IC, an HC-05 module is used to connect the system with android device.

# Sound Reactive LED Strip
The project uses a parallax sound impact sensor and an Arduino. The parallax sound impact sensor is that it picks up sounds that cross a certain decibel level
